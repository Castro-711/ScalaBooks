/**
  * We write function types like
  *     (A, B) => C
  * where A & B are types of the parameters and C is the result type.
  *     () => C
  * this function takes no arguments and results in C
  *     A => B
  * if a function has only one parameter the parentheses may be dropped
  *
  * In our abstraction example we want f to be a function that accepts two Ints and returns an Int
  * Thus we can write
  *   (Int, Int) => Int
